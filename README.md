One Vs All Calculator for the FireRed/LeafGreen Trainer Tower

Currently gives the stats for Single-Battle opponent pokemon based on data-mined base stats, ivs and evs.

Will eventually store stat arrays for your team of up to six and compare their attack values and stored
moves against the opponents' defense stats.
